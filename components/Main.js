          I am an introvert in a large group but become an extrovert among friends and in small groups.

          It all began when I was really young and tended to take apart small electronics toys to see how they worked. I would never play with action figures, any toy that I owned needed to do something or involve some kind of activity such as building lego.

        <h6>Primary School</h6>
        <p>
          Soon after moving back to Cape Town from England, it was time for primary school, where I was promptly placed in the school that my mother was teaching at: Holy Cross Sisters School Belville. Going to a school with your mother as the teacher is always tough. I would always have to be the model student and the picture purfect child, otherwise my mother would most definately hear about it before I even got home.
        </p>
        <h6>High School</h6>
        <p>
          Next came high school. After much searching and many open days, the perfect school for me was finally found: CBC St John's Parklands.
        </p>
        <h6>University</h6>
        <p>
          With my big operation still on the front of my famil's mind, universities outside Cape Town were off the table. It became clear farely quickly that there was only one choice to follow my heart in the direction of robotics. Stellenbosch University's engineering faculty was by far the best in the country and it became the only choice. I enroled in mechatronics engineering and the grind began.

          When it comes to programming languages, there is very little that i do not know or cannot learn on the fly. I am capable in many languages and can learn any syntax for new languages or packages quickly. However, I am self taught, some technical jargon, well known algorithms or frameworks and libraries are unknwon to me and I have a lot to learn. What I am confident in is the follwoing:

        <p>Other than programming microcotnrollers and microprocessors, I am well versed in electronics and electrical engineering. In university I much preffered to do elecatrical orriented modules as apose to mechanical oriented modules. Subjects that I am well versed in are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Electronics design</li>
          <li>Operation amplifiers</li>
          <li>Transistors and transistor circuits: BJTs and MOSFETs</li>

          When I started university, I quickly came to the realisation that to have any fun on campus I would be in need of some additional funds. At the time i was an 18 year old who only knew two things: how to do well at school and table tennis. So began my journey as a coach and a tutor.
        </p> 
        <p>
          After returning to the sport when I started university, I won the Cape Winelands district tournament and was approached to coach up some juniors by parents wanting their children to do better. This began a new journey for me as I was able to coach 2 children from near beginner level to making the quater finals of the South African National Champioship in their age catagory in just a year. Since then I have become the head coach for Stellenbosch University and coach both juniors and seniors at the Goodwood Sports Club.
